# AI Agent Large Email Export and Search

A complete pipeline for exporting large email archives from Yahoo Mail and performing AI-powered triage using local LLMs.
The workflow was built around an AI agent such as OpenClaw or Hermes to manage large mailbox downloads, sort the mail, and deliver a curated
list of high-value messages for later archiving.

The pipeline uses a local GPU and Ollama-based models for triage instead of burning cloud tokens. The same architecture can be adapted to
other IMAP-backed email systems, but the Yahoo-specific limits and retry behavior documented here are the ones that were actually exercised.

## Overview

This project solves two hard problems:
1. **Export**: Yahoo Mail IMAP has a practical 10,000-message folder limit. This repo contains the working rotation workflow used to export a
   132K-mailbox without losing local `.eml` copies.
2. **Search and triage**: Once exported, index the local `.eml` archive with SQLite FTS5, review it in a local browser UI, and optionally use
   local LLMs (Ollama) for embeddings and triage.

## Configuration

Before running, edit these files to match your setup:

### 1. Email Address and Paths

In `export-scripts/purge_cycle.py` and `export-scripts/move_to_exports.py`:
```python
# EDIT THIS: Your Yahoo Mail email address
EMAIL = "your-email@yahoo.com"

# EDIT THIS: Set your base directory
BASE_DIR = Path("~/email-purge").expanduser()
```

In all `triage-pipeline/*.py` files:
```bash
# Optional: defaults to ~/email-purge
EMAIL_PURGE_DIR=~/email-purge
EMAIL_INDEX_DB=~/email-purge/email_index.db
EMAIL_EML_ROOT=~/email-purge/eml
EMAIL_KEEP_JSONL=~/email-purge/triage/keep.jsonl
EMAIL_DEFER_JSONL=~/email-purge/triage/defer.jsonl
```

### 2. VIP Senders and Search Terms

In `triage-pipeline/pre_filter.py`, edit these sections:

```python
# EDIT THIS: Add domains/addresses that should always be kept
VIP_SENDERS = {
    # "your-employer.com",
    # "important-client.com",
}
VIP_DOMAINS = {
    # "courts.gov",
    # "your-employer.com",
}

# EDIT THIS: Add keywords specific to your needs
SEARCH_TERMS = [
    # Universities/Schools
    # "university name",
    # People (family, colleagues)
    # "firstname", "lastname",
    # Companies/Orgs
    # "company-name",
    # Locations
    # "country-name", "city-name",
]
```

### 3. Yahoo App Password

Generate an app password at https://login.yahoo.com/account/security/app-passwords

Use this password (not your regular password) in the scripts.

## Quick Start

### 1. Export from Yahoo Mail

```bash
cd export-scripts
python3 purge_cycle.py
```

This moves emails in batches to temporary folders, downloads them, and clears the folders. Repeat until complete.

See [docs/YAHOO_EXPORT_GUIDE.md](docs/YAHOO_EXPORT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

To download Sent mail without the INBOX rotation/delete workflow:

```bash
cd export-scripts
YAHOO_EMAIL=your-email@yahoo.com YAHOO_PASSWORD=your-app-password python3 download_sent.py --folder Sent
```

`download_sent.py` is resumable and read-only by default: it selects the remote folder read-only, skips existing local `.eml` files, and writes
metadata to `metadata/download_sent_state.json`.

### 2. Build the SQLite/FTS search index

```bash
cd triage-pipeline
python3 email_indexer.py --rebuild
```

This creates `~/email-purge/email_index.db` with one canonical row per `.eml` file and an FTS5 index over subject, sender, recipients, and
clean message body text.

### 3. Browse and search locally

```bash
python3 triage_viewer.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8765/ and use the search box across all mail, keep/defer piles, or specific folders. The viewer serves original `.eml`
files and attachments from disk; it does not expose the server beyond localhost.

### 4. Pre-filter (Rule-based)

```bash
cd triage-pipeline
python3 pre_filter.py
```

Applies rule-based filtering:
- VIP senders (employers, courts)
- Search terms (names, companies, countries)
- Deadline keywords
- Attachment detection

Outputs: `keep.jsonl`, `drop.jsonl`, `needs_review.jsonl`

### 5. Build Vector Index

```bash
python3 build_embeddings.py
```

Creates embeddings using Ollama's `nomic-embed-text` model and stores in SQLite with sqlite-vec.

### 6. LLM Triage

```bash
python3 triage_emails.py
```

Uses local LLM (qwen3:4b-instruct) to score emails for importance (0-100) and categorize them.

### 7. Generate Report

```bash
python3 summary_report.py
```

Creates human-readable summary of triage results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Python packages:
  - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML-to-text extraction in the search indexer
- Ollama with models:
  - `nomic-embed-text` (for embeddings)
  - `qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M` (for triage)
- Yahoo Mail account with app password
- ~10GB disk space for 100K emails

## Key Insights

### Yahoo IMAP Limitations

| Server | SELECT Limit | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| imap.mail.yahoo.com | 10,000 | Standard server |
| export.imap.mail.yahoo.com | 100,000 | Slow FETCH |

**Solution**: Move emails to temporary folders under 10K, download, repeat.

### Why Not Just Use the Export Server?

The export server (`export.imap.mail.yahoo.com`) supports 100K messages but:
- Single-message FETCH is extremely slow (seconds per message)
- Batch fetches hang indefinitely
- Not practical for bulk download

### The MOVE Command

The IMAP `MOVE` command is atomic and reliable:
```python
m._simple_command('MOVE', '1:1000', 'export1')
```

**Critical**: Always use `seq 1:N` because sequence numbers shift after each MOVE.

## Performance

| Phase | Rate | 100K Emails |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Export | 1K msgs / 25 sec | ~40 min (move) + ~30 hours (download) |
| SQLite/FTS index | 100s msgs / sec | minutes |
| Pre-filter | 1000 msgs / sec | ~2 min |
| Embeddings | 50 msgs / min | ~30 hours |
| Triage | 1 msg / 2 sec | ~50 hours |

**Total**: ~100 hours for full pipeline (mostly automated)

## Contributing

This was built for a real 132,000-email migration. PRs welcome for:
- Parallel downloads
- Resume capability
- Support for Gmail/Outlook
- Better handling for completion-state watchdogs
- Better embedding models

## ClawHub Skill

The repo now includes a ClawHub-ready skill bundle:

- `yahoomail-export-skill/SKILL.md`
- `yahoomail-export-skill/agents/openai.yaml`

That bundle reflects the final working workflow and the practical Yahoo IMAP limits observed during the migration.

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

This tool performs **destructive operations** on your email account:

1. **MOVE operations**: Emails are moved from INBOX to temporary folders
2. **DELETE operations**: Emails are deleted from temporary folders after download

**Risk**: If the script fails between MOVE and download, emails may be lost.

**Mitigation**:
- Test on a small folder first
- Use Yahoo's web interface export as backup
- Monitor the process closely
- Verify message counts match before/after each cycle

**Recommendation**: Run manually first. Only use automated cron after thorough testing.

The authors are not responsible for data loss. Use at your own risk.
